Assignment 1

I would calculate mode of SparkContext data by applying data.zipWithIndex().countByKey(). Now I have a list of key value pairs, where key is the element and value is its count. Next I would apply keys().max() to the remaining data, finding the biggest amount of a single key. Then I would return to use the key value pair array and use lookup(x) where x is the previously acquired biggest amount. Now I have found the mode.

The data set has so many different values that even the key value pair data would be pretty big. Data consisting of integers, preferably from a small range would be much better.
